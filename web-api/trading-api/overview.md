# Overview

### Introduction

The trading API is designed to perform trading operations like placing orders, getting quotes, configuring price alerts. 

The documentation for trading API is structured by categories, each representing a different set of functionality. The first section — **Authentication** — covers the process of generating authentication tokens that must be provided in the header of all other requests. All subsequent sections cover different aspects of AutoShares, ranging from order placement to submitting user feedback.

Each API request is described on two pages; the first page introduces you to the API request and explains how to properly use the request parameters and the typical mistakes to avoid; the second page is strictly technical, outlining all of the header and body parameters along with their types, the range of request status codes, as well as all possible responses:
