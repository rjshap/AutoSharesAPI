# Working with the APIs

### Introduction

The APIs are designed to perform operations like placing orders and trading, streaming buying power and account values, poaitions, charts, price alerts, and transactions. 

The documentation for the APIs are structured by categories, each representing a different set of functionality. The first section — **Authentication** — covers the process of generating authentication tokens that must be provided in the header of all other requests. All subsequent sections cover different aspects of AutoSharesthe APIs, ranging from order placement to working with self-directed trading accounts.

Each API request is described on two pages; the first page introduces you to the API request and explains how to properly use the request parameters and the typical mistakes to avoid; the second page is strictly technical, outlining all of the header and body parameters along with their types, the range of request status codes, as well as all possible responses:
